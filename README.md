# PlanetaryGearbox

To run the planetary gearbox optimization file, the required files to download are:

constraint.m
evalFitness.m
explainX.m
fval.m

GA550.m
goptions.m
runAllOptimizations.m
runOneOptimization.m

When all the files are in the same folder in MATLAB, open runAllOptimizations, set the desired minimum constraints for the sun and ring gears, and run the script.
